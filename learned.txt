/* Below is an example of how to add a private variable within a class you cannot
access the private variable and must use getter / setter methods in order to get 
and set the variable value.

// method 1 - Private by convention 
class Bottle {
    constructor() {
        this._water = 50 // prepend with '_' to denote that the variable is private
    }

    // must use getters / setters for private variables
    getWater() {
        return this._water
    }

    setWater(value) {
        this._water = value
    }
}

/* You can still modify _water, the underscore doesn't change or modify the variabe in any way. the underscore is just used to indicate that this particular variable is private. */ 

// method 2 - Real Private Members
class Car {
    #fuel = 50 // prepend with '#' to make variable private

    getFuel() {
        return this.#fuel
    }
    
    setFuel(value) {
        this.#fuel = value
        if (value > 100) this.#fuel = 100
    }

const car = new Car();
console.log(car.getFuel()); // 50

/* For this example, the # actually changes the variable to private and can only be modified and accessed using getter / setter methods. */
